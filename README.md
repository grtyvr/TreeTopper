# TreeTopper
Mechanical drawing and STL files for the Tree Topper project.

This is a tree top ornament for an xmas tree.  The arms are detachable so that it fits on the bed of small printers (and perhaps even it can be disassembled for storage).

You need to print 6 copies of the arm and one copy of the centre ring.  The parts are designed to snap together.  To do that is a bit tricky as the arms and the centre ring have matching dovetails and a slight draft angle.  That makes it a bit like a three dimensional dovetail with two dovetailing planes. To mate them the method I find works best is to locate the far end of the arm dovetail into the back of the notch on the centre ring while tilting the arm up by about 25 degrees.  Then some gentle persuasion should enable you to rotated the arm down and into position.  Take a look at the assembly video (here)[https://youtu.be/rpawWabgLZk]

I printed this in transparent PLA since it is intended to be back lit with WS2812 LED's.   Not affiliated with these folks, but here is an example of the type of LED's I used.

Or if you wanted a more muted and diffuse effect you might try white or some other coloured filaments.

I am powering it with a Pixelblaze from Ben Henke.
